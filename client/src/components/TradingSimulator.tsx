 What We Accomplished:

  1. TradingView-Style Chart Zones âœ…

  - Updated TradingChartWidget.tsx with green/red profit/loss shaded zones
  - Zones only appear from entry point forward (like TradingView)
  - Green = profit area, Red = loss area
  - Matches the TradingView screenshot you showed me

  2. Restored Authentication System âœ…

  The login system was missing from the codebase. We restored:
  - Login.tsx - Full login/register page with Google OAuth button
  - auth.ts - API library for login/register/logout calls
  - App.tsx - Added /login route
  - server/routes.ts - Added all auth endpoints (/api/auth/register, /api/auth/login, /api/auth/logout, /api/auth/me)
  - server/index.ts - Added session middleware and passport initialization, fixed CORS ordering
  - server/passport-config.ts - Passport local and Google OAuth strategies
  - server/storage.ts - Full storage implementation with getUserByEmail(), password hashing with bcrypt
  - shared/schema.ts - User schema with email, password, googleId fields

  3. Fixed Multiple Deployment Issues âœ…

  - Added missing dependencies: bcrypt, passport-google-oauth20, @types/bcrypt
  - Fixed CORS by moving middleware before session initialization
  - Fixed storage interface to include all auth methods
  - Switched to in-memory storage (MemStorage) since database isn't configured yet

  4. Set Up Git Access âœ…

  - Configured GitHub Personal Access Token for direct pushing
  - All changes are now automatically pushed to GitHub
  - Cloudflare Pages and Render auto-deploy from GitHub

  Current Status:

  Waiting for: Render to finish deploying the latest changes (storage fix)

  That's everything! Tomorrow just wait for Render deployment to finish and test the login! ðŸš€
